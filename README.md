# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview:

The purpose of this analysis is to apply machine learning models to aid into credit card risk. With a given dataset we are going to use diffferent techniques to come up with a model that is able to predict wheter a loan is high risk or low risk. Then we are going to evaluate the performance of these models and determine wich one is better and should be used to predict credit risk. 

## Results


Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
